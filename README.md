# Software-security-vulnerability-Assessment

>Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a consulting company that develops individualzied financial plans for their customers. They wanted to modernize their operations by ensuring they are using the most current and effective software security. This included a file verification step in the form of a checksum, add secure communication mechanisms, and secure coding protocols.

>What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

I believe that it is important to code securely because there is a lot of sensitive data out there. In most applications these days, there is some sort of personal information or unique identifier that goes into signing up for a newsletter, membership, etc. Having proper security measures in place add integrity and transparency to the company and make it easier to instill trust to the customers. 

>What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

The most challenging part of the assessment was creating the certificate and running the checksum. Working through the bugs took some time, but it makes me understand the "what" and "why" of the coding that goes into these pieces. 

>How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

In the future I will be sure to use dependency check report, the suppression files, and the hash function to increase my layers of security.

>How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

Running the checksum and checking the dependency report after introducing suppression files for the false positives were the steps I took to ensure the code and software was functional and secure. The dependency reports do a great job showing whether the new vulnerabilites were suppressed correctly. The checksum verification is also a great tool because it gives visible verification that the hash that was implemented happened.

>What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

The biggest help that I used this time and during other builds was Stack Overflow. I always find great steps here to potential solutions when I'm in a bind or something is not running as expected. 

>Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I would show them pieces of my first project that have the research done for the vulnerabilities. I believe that my skills are shown in the display of the dependency check report and the thoroughness of this piece.
